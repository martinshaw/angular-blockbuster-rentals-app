2. Run `npm run serve-api` to start the mock server

3. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to view the app

4. Navigate to `http://localhost:4202/` to view the mock server UI

## Future Development

I gave myself a three day deadline ending at the end of business on Friday to demonstrate some of the Angular which I have been learning over the past few weeks.

There are many features and improvements which would be made if this were a real project, and which I may add in the near future:

* Use a real BE API server.
* Move some of the logic which emulates backend changes to the API server endpoints to simplify FE code.
* Add virtualisation of lists and grids.
* Add filtering and searching to movie, customer and rental 'index' and 'show' pages.
* Implement 'show' pages for customers and movies.
* Implement 'edit' pages for rentals, customers and movies.
* Implement functionality to return individual items.
* Implement functionality to return all items.
* Improve customer search component in rentals sidebar.
* Enlistment of new customers
* Removal of customers
* Improve responsive styling on 'show' pages
* Move rental creation sidebar to bottom on small devices
* Improve handling of dates (timezones)
* Much much more could be added ...
